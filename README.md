# 1D Cellular Automat

The design includes the division of the array into 3 pairs of numbers + rule 190, with boundary conditions:
- periodic,
- absorption.

At the beginning of the programme, the user can enter the grid size and the number of iterations.

Technologies used in the project: 
- Python with library: numpy - a library for scientific calculations, operations on multidimensional arrays and matrices,
- Jupyter Notebook.
